## Description
This project was developed using the T3 stack, which combines TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, tRPC, and Prisma. I enjoyed working on this project within the given timeframe, despite facing challenges while learning the framework. Transitioning from the MERN stack to the T3 stack has been a rewarding experience, and I'm excited about the potential it offers for future development.

## Features
- In-page routing for improved load times and user experience.
- Responsive design powered by Tailwind CSS.
- Database management with Prisma.

## Getting Started

To run the project in development mode, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone [REPO_URL]
   cd [REPO_NAME]
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Run the `index.bat` file located in the root folder to install all necessary dependencies.

3. **Sync the database**:
   ```bash
   npx prisma db push
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables**:
   Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env` to configure your environment variables.

5. **Start the project**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

6. **Access the app**:
   Once the project is running, it will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Please do not close the terminal.

## Logging In
1. Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and click "Sign in."
2. Enter your email, and a login link will be sent to the terminal.
3. Click the link to log in and access the app.

## Technologies Used
- **TypeScript**: Ensures type safety and enhances code quality.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling and responsive design.
- **tRPC**: For building type-safe APIs.
- **Prisma**: For database access and management.

## Future Improvements
With more time, I aim to master the T3 stack and create even more dynamic, high-quality projects.

## Conclusion
Iâ€™ve had a fantastic experience working on this project, and I would love the opportunity to collaborate with the team further!
